hey there! welcome to my little space on the internet.

i've been wanting to create a personal blog for a while now - somewhere i can share my thoughts, music, and art without the noise of social media. this feels more like *my* space, you know?

expect diary entries, random musings, new tracks i'm working on, and photos from my adventures. thanks for stopping by!
