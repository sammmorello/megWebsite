Hey there! Welcome to my little space on the internet.

I've been wanting to create a personal blog for a while now - somewhere I can share my thoughts, music, and art without the noise of social media. This feels more like *my* space, you know?

Expect diary entries, random musings, new tracks I'm working on, and photos from my adventures. Thanks for stopping by!
