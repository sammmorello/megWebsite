It's 2am and I can't sleep. Been working on a new track and it's all I can think about.

There's something magical about creating music in the quiet hours when the rest of the world is asleep. No distractions, just me and the sounds in my head.

Tomorrow I'll probably hate everything I made tonight, but right now? It feels perfect.
